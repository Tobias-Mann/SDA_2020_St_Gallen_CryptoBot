Name of Quantlet: SDA_2020_St_Gallen_04_VisualizeMonteCarlo

Published in: SDA_2020_St_Gallen_CryptoBot

Description: This quantlet is part of other quantlets and should ideally be executed after the quantlets before (see parent folders). Here the monte carlo simulations performed in the quantlet 'SDA_2020_St_Gallen_02_Simulations' are plotted. First, a plot showing the performance of the q-learning algorithm with 100 randomly generated initial q-tables. Second, a plot showing the performance of the q-learning algorithm in comaprison to a simple Buy and Hold and considers the confidence intervals. 

Keywords: QLearning, Monte Carlo, Trading Bot, BTC, Bitcoin, Timeseries, Technical Indicators
